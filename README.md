## AllPeripheral

**Background of this project**
This project or repository has derived from the idea from my project [PyPheperial](https://github.com/gooday2die/PyPheperial). I was doing a lot of tests and experiments with that code. However, was feeling something incomplete. The program PyPheperial was based on Python script. Python itself is nice to use, however some SDKs only supported C++ or JAVA. Which means that I had to transfer this SDKs into Python format using some kind of complicated process. Which resulted in huge amount of resource usage. So I have managed to build a new project out of C++ and Python both.

**About this project**
As I have mentioned up above, the project is made with C++ and Python. All low-level SDKs that control peripheral devices are processed with C++ engine that I have made. This time, I am using C++ for more performance. Also, the high-level operations are done in Python side of the program. Since one of this project's most loved feature which is ScreenReactive lighting needs clustering and all those high level works, I am performing all those jobs using Python. In short, all low-level things are done with C++, all high-level things are done with Python!

**So... What now?**
I am currently developing this C++ side of the software in an efficient way. I am kind of doing extreme optimization to use less resource. Due to COVID-19, I am not going to my school. So I have plenty of time when I am not studying my major (which is also computer science BTW). Also, I recently had came across the fact that this SDKs support MacOS. So I am working on it currently. 

**Any more info?**
If you need any more information or would like to suggest me any kind of idea, please let me know via edina00@naver.com. I am always open for new ideas and suggestions. Any other contacts are welcomed via that email.
