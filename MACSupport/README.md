## Mac Support
I am personally a huge fan of apple. Those are Mac devices that I own personally. Just to let you know.

- MBP "15 CTO 2010 - Retired... A good old friend of mine.
- MBP "15 CTO 2016 - For Camera and Other Works.
 - MBP "15 CTO 2017 - For YouTube watching and Music Production
 - MBP "15 CTO 2018 - For Development. 

I did not think those peripheral device companies would support any MacOS supports until last week. However, it seems they do. So I would be offering MacOS supports. 

**Fully supported SDKs**
 - Corsair - ICUE SDK. Fully working on 10.15
 - RAZER - Working on it. Would not work above 10.15 (Catalina)

## Notice
This is my first time with Xcode environment development. I have done many small projects on Xcode, however this is my first time with Frameworks and all those external dynamic libraries. So, the code might not be perfect. If you happen to find any crashes or bugs, please please let me know. I will be modifying as soon as possible.
