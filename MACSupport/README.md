## Mac Support
I am personally a huge fan of apple. Those are Mac devices that I own personally. Just to let you know.

- MBP "15 CTO 2010 - Retired... A good old friend of mine.
- MBP "15 CTO 2016 - For Camera and Other Works.
 - MBP "15 CTO 2017 - For YouTube watching and Music Production
 - MBP "15 CTO 2018 - For Development. 

I did not think those peripheral device companies would support any MacOS supports until last week. However, it seems they do. So I would be offering MacOS supports. 

**Fully supported SDKs**
 - Corsair - ICUE SDK. Fully working on 10.15
 - RAZER - Working on it. Would not work above 10.15 (Catalina)

**Confirmed Working Devices**

 - Corsair K95 RGB Platinum 
 - Corsair Glaive RGB Pro
 - Corsair MM800 RGB Pro
 - Corsair VOID RGB Pro

## For Devs
Hello, I am the main contributor of this project Gooday2die. I had so much time debugging and reverse enginnering all those codes out there on GitHub. So I do know how it feels. It is such a time consuming task and kind of "Reinventing the wheel" process for everyone. So I would be adding a bunch of comments in the codes and bunch of documentations as much as possible. Also, if you happen to debug or see my codes and cannot find out what I was intending in the code, please let me know via my email, edina00@naver.com. I will answer your problems as soon as possible. Also, I am quite a noob in Xcode development and cannot get a single idea of how those Xcode developers had in mind while making this IDE. So if you have any of experience of Xcode please let me know. Any help would be really appreciated.

Also, I am preparing a official document for the program. Check this link below!

## How to install
I would be uploading install guid as soon as possible. Please stay tuned.

## Notice
This is my first time with Xcode environment development. I have done many small projects on Xcode, however this is my first time with Frameworks and all those external dynamic libraries. So, the code might not be perfect. If you happen to find any crashes or bugs, please please let me know. I will be modifying as soon as possible. 

Contacts via email edina00@naver.com

Also, Currently I have checked it working on Xcode environment, however was not able to export this project successfully. I am trying as much as possible. It would take some time. If you know well about Xcode,, please please let me know.  Any help would be appreciated very much!
